       China is where it's at. More and more US based software companies are recognizing that in order to compete, serving the China market is critical. To do this effectively, local partners are the key to success. China is unique and has some important nuances that cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>
SKT Lab helps startup companies as well as mature enterprises enter the China market in the following ways:<br/><br/>

        <li><span style="color:#0132ad; font-weight:bold;">Localization and internationalization of products to fit local customer requirements</span> - Foreign firms entering the Chinese market must be familiar with unique Chinese-related product features in their development of localized offerings.</li>
        <li><span style="color:#0132ad; font-weight:bold;">Joint sales and marketing by leveraging SKT Lab's existing customer base and partners</span> - Selling in China is still largely dependent on local relationships that have been built over a number of years. Foreign software vendors setting out to achieve sales goals will find themselves in a bind without a local partner to open doors. SKT Lab has deep relationships all over China.</li>
        <li><span style="color:#0132ad; font-weight:bold;">Implementation partner, reseller or joint venture</span> - Engage SKT Lab as a partner to help expand your reach. We proudly represent hundreds of international technology companies to distribute their software products throughout China in a variety of partnership models.</li>
        <li><span style="color:#0132ad; font-weight:bold;">Consulting services including navigating local government relationships, policies, and rules</span> - SKT Lab has deep government relationships and can help establish alignment between the strategies of your company and the policies of China's leadership.
