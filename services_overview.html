            <h2>Engagement Model</h2>
            <p>
            As soon as we get your inquiry, we will follow up with you within 24 hours to gather your requirements. From our side the participants typically include an onsite architect and a business analyst/sales manager. If required, an NDA can be signed prior to our discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
            Typically, our architect will start discussing and proposing the technical stack based on your requirements on the initial call. Subsequently, a quote/proposal would be submitted to you within 24 hours after the call.
            </p>
            <p>
            We generally offer the following engagement models:
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>* Fixed price:</strong>This is typical when the client has well documented functional requirements for us to make a reasonable estimate on time and resources required. In this case SKT Lab is responsible for project management and final deliverables. Multiple milestones will be set during the course of the product development for client to review progress.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>* Time and material: </strong> of our customers prefer this model due to their agile development preference.  In this model we typically provide resources only and the client manages the overall project progress.
            </p>
            <p>
            The preferred engagement model by many of our clients involves a combination of onsite engineers and offshore engineers. The onsite engineer may take the role of a project leader and liaison for communication with the offshore team, which also aids in bypassing the timezone difference.
